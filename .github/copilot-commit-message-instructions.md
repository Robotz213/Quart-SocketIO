Use the conventional commit message format.

Separating by lines, always try to detail what was done

Separating by lines, if there are types of changes (ex: 3 files were refactored, 2 were just documents), always try to detail what was done in each file, grouping several by type of change (ex: `'Chore' \n index.html: added js module`), informing the name of the file in the first line along with the type of change (chore, refact, etc.)
